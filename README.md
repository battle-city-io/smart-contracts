<h2> Public Smart Contracts </h2>

Even though all public contracts' source code will be published on Binance Smart Chain, this repository acts as a centralized place for people to read and review those contracts more easily.

This repository also contains official addresses of BattleCity.io (owned by MangoX Company Limited)'s contracts.

<i> Note: Some contract logics are not fully decentralized as of now. After the development is done, all those logics will be locked so no changes can be made and full decentralization would be achieved. </i>
